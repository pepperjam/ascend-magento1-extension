 * This class is composed of methods used as callbacks to the feed generation

 * 1. It will always include an "item" key with a value of the object
 *    being prcessed.
 * 2. It will always include a "store" key with a value of the store context
 *    in which the feed is being processed.
 * 3. Will contain additioanl key/value pairs set in the callback mappings
 *    in config.xml
 *
 * Additional key/value pairs may be included but may not be guaranteed.
 * If the methods make any additional assumptions about the contents of the
 * `$params` array, they must be stated with the method. This should include
 * any additional key/value pairs expected to be set in the config.xml.
 *
 * All such mapping methods are expected to return a single value that can be
 * inserted directly into the resulting feed file.
